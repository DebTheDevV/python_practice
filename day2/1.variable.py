# in python , variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program . a variable is created the moment u assign a value to it using the assingment operator (=)

#it is a dynamically typed language which means u dont need to specify the data type of the variable

#34age =4 #invalid because variable cannot start with a number
age = 32
#a$$ge - 45  # invalid as varibales cannot contain special characters
