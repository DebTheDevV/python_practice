print('Hello " World') 
# we can put double quote inside single quote
# but the moment , 
# we put single quote inside single quote , our interpreter will get confused

print(" hello \" harry")
print('Hello world' , "Harry" , 5555) 
#  if we give multiple arguments to a print statement it will automatically print space between two arguments


# in python , with 2 print statements ,  a new line is automatically printed  [unlike cpp where even with 2 cout staements it will print in a single line with no space if not written with \n or endl]
